# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_and_Prediction
Final Project for DSC630 Predictive Analytics

The scope of this project consists of analyzing the hotel dataset, cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis, figure out if there any outliers in the data, and figure out which features contribute most to hotel cancellations. 

The goal of this project was to thus figure out if predictive analytics
can be used to figure out cancellations for the Hotel Demand dataset. More specifically this
project figured out that a prediction model can be created that figures out whether or not a
customer would cancel their hotel reservation based on the data of that booking with a very
high accuracy score. This will potentially lead to figuring out which type of situation drives a
cancellation, and what improvements the hotels can make to drive their cancellations lower. 

The results of the models showed to be very promising. For the Logistic Regression
model, it was nice to see a decent accuracy score of over 0.75 and the classification report
showed and F1-score of 0.85. On the other hand, the Random Forest Classifier I feel had shown
better performance. The Random forest had accuracy score of 0.99, and the classification
report showed the F1-score to be 0.99. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Random Forest
Classifier model would be best in figuring out hotel cancellations for this dataset.
